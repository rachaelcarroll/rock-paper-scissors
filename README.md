## Overview and Project Goals
The goal of [final solo project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/rock-paper-scissors-solo.html) for Mod1 at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/) was to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.

### Why was this project created?
To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:

1. Writing clean and DRY HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
2. Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
3. The interaction between multiple class files
4. Implementation of client-side data persistence by utilizing JSON and localStorage

## Features

- When the game loads, the user will see a left section displaying their emoji and wins and a right section displaying the computer emoji and wins. The main section directs the user to **Choose Your Game** and displays a Classic version and a *Magic* version.

- Based on the user's game choice, 3 or 4 icons will appear on the screen. Rock, Paper, Scissors for Classic.  Spell, Voodoo Doll, Crystals, Witch for Magic.

- The user may hover over their selection and click to choose their fighter. The computer will then make it's choice and both fighters will be displayed.  The game will result in either a player1 win, computer win, or draw. The respective wins will be displayed on the right and left sections.

- User has the option to change the game version at any time and their wins will not reset.  They may also leave the page and return to see that their wins are still displayed... a never-ending game of Rock, Paper, Scissors!

## Future Additions
- *New game* functionality to reset the wins and start a new game.
- *Choose your emoji* functionality to toggle through Player1 emojis.
- *Light & dark mode* to alter the game board based on the user's Classic or Magic game choice.
